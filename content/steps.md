## Remarks

Each step runs in its own process on an agent and has access to the pipeline workspace on a local hard drive.
This behavior means environment variables aren't preserved between steps but file system changes are.

All steps, regardless of whether they're documented in this article, support the following properties:

- **displayName**
- **name**
- **condition**
- **continueOnError**
- **enabled**
- **env**
- **timeoutInMinutes**


## Examples

```yaml
steps:
- script: echo This runs in the default shell on any machine
- bash: |
    echo This multiline script always runs in Bash.
    echo Even on Windows machines!
- pwsh: |
    Write-Host "This multiline script always runs in PowerShell Core."
    Write-Host "Even on non-Windows machines!"
```
